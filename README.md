# Running data

This project turns a rather unorganized kind of data, jotted down exercise notes about run times and laps, and uses programming in R to scan the text and turn it into an actual dataset. The data is then manipulated to calculate metrics such as run speed, or total distance ran taking into account the different sizes laps have on different tracks. Finally, using Tableau the data is visualized in a comprehensive and interactive dashboard. Therefore, this project goes through all the steps from data collection to cleaning, manipulation and presentation.
